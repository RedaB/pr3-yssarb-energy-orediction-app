Energy Prediction
Using Machine Learning to Predict Hourly Energy Consumption


Energy Prediction
Using Machine Learning to Predict Energy Hourly

 

Know what you use!
Both energy companies and consumers benefit from conserving energy. Whether the motivations for energy conservation are economic, environmental, or personal, the energy company or consumer must first understand patterns of energy usage to take the best conservation approach. EPredict will uses historical data and forecasts energy consumption from the current date and time for any specified number of hours into the future. The ability to predict energy consumption based on historical hourly data allows users to strategically focus conservation efforts on the most impactful opportunities and prioritize key business objectives.

About the Project
Machine Learning for Predicting Industrial Hourly Energy

Based on the scope of work for this project, the business was particular interested in understanding how energy was used by day and hours. This analysis will help the business understand how to proactively manage energy demands as they will use this analysis to strategically plan for brownouts and blackouts, develop consumer conservation incentive programs based on patterns of usage while educating consumers about consumption patterns, and adjust rate structure based on usage patterns.

The Data & Model

The Data
We used 14 years of electric energy data and piloted our model with one of the nation’s largest electricity producers, American Electric Power. American Electric Power (AEP) is a major investor-owned electric utility in the United States of America, delivering electricity to more than five million customers in 11 states.

The Model

EPredict is based on the XGBoost model. XGBoost stands for extreme gradient boosting, a regression technique utilizing decision trees. The XGBoost model is designed for speed and model performance. XGBoost models “dominate on classification and regression predictive modeling problems”. This model is uses day of year and hour for energy prediction demands. The model was piloted with 14 years of energy demand data from one of the nation's largest electricity generators, American Electric Power (AEP).
